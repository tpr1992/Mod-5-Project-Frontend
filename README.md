### notSpotify();

To start, please run `npm start` on port 3000.

- This is my final project for Flatiron School's immersive software engineering course. It is intended to be my own personal take on a Spotify style music streaming app. The frontend is built entirely in React.js, is styled with SemanticUI and custom CSS.

- Authorization is done in the backend through the Spotify Web API using OAuth. This allows users access to personal information and specific permissions in the form of scope are defined to define what my app has permission to use.

- With the in-browser Spotify media player, users can live stream any and all songs available on Spotify. I am also currently working on building my own custom media player, but it is too soon to tell if I will be adding this to the final project.

- Users can search through their personal playlists, as well as artists and tracks.

- Dark Mode and Light Mode toggle now added, this implements CSS changes to the color scheme and the drop shadow in the title for increased readability.

- In order to use the app, users must have a valid Spotify Premium account, as well as have a local server running which can be found at (https://github.com/tpr1992/Mod-5-Project-Backend).

Please let me know if you have any suggestions or recommendations on how to better implement things as this project is a way for me to refine my skills. I will periodically update this over the coming months and as of today, Sept 2 2019, this app is still currently a work in progress.
